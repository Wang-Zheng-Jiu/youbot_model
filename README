KUKA youBot kinematics and dynamics

In the list below each rigid body has a relative position and orientation with respect to its parent frame. Orientation is described in Euler angles. The composite rotation convention is Yaw Pitch Roll (ZYX). Joint type describes the type of a constraint, where type can be one of the following: revolute - a hinge joint that rotates along the axis and has a limited range specified by the upper and lower limits; continuous - a continuous hinge joint that rotates around the axis and has not upper and lower limits; prismatic - a sliding joint that slides along the axis, and has a limited range specified by the upper and lower limits. Joint axis is the axis of rotation for revolute joint or the axis of translation for prismatic joint. Joint axis is specified in the joint frame. The dynamics related parameters are mass, relative pose of center of mass and moment of inertia tensor.

    base frame
        Relative positionXYZ = “0mm 0mm 84mm”;
        Mass = “19.803kg”.
        Note: Mass of the base includes the metal frame, the plastic cover, electronics, the battery, the motors and the shafts. It only excludes wheels and the plate.

    front-left wheel joint
        Parent joint = “base frame”;
        Relative positionXYZ = “228mm 158mm -34mm”;
        Joint type = “continuous”;
        Joint axis = “0 1 0”;
        Mass = “1.40kg”.
        Note: Mass of the wheel excludes the motor and the shaft. The motor and the shaft are already included in the base.

KUKA youBot 5-degree-of-freedom arm

    arm base frame
        Parent joint = “base”;

        Joint type = “fixed”;
        Mass = “0.961kg”.
        Note: If the KUKA YouBot arm system is operated without a mobile platform, the arm base frame is the origin frame. In this case, its relative positionXYZ is “0,0,0”. If the arm is mounted on the mobile platform, the arm base frame represents a coordinate transformation with respect to the mobile platform base frame.
